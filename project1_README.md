On a map of Antarctica, n polar stations are represented as points, each with natural coordinates on a rectangular grid. A direct connection between two stations is possible if the straight-line distance 
between them is less than two units on the map. Stations that are connected directly or through transitive connections form "lands" where each station belongs to exactly one land.

Determine the number of Arctic lands.

Input Format
The first line contains the number of stations n.
The next n lines each contain two numbers â€“ the coordinates of each station. All numerical values are natural numbers and do not exceed 100.

Output Format
Output the number of Arctic lands.
